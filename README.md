# Project-Blue-Fist
Project Blue Fist is the next iteration of my P.O.C. project, [FistBump](https://github.com/eliddell1/FistBump), a handheld pentesting tool that can be used to grab WPA handshake and PMKID hashes on Red Team engagements. It was designed to allow one to get close to the target network without raising suspision.  The original proof of concept was a stand alone device that launched a very effective attack via the push of a button, but was not exactly stealthy has it made use of blinking lights to indicate various stages of the attack as well as the outcome.  While extremely effective, it proved to look a bit like a cartoon detinator, defeating its goal to be stealthy.

Project Blue-Fist aims to remedy this by removing the led lights as well as the trigger button, leaving it slimmer and only having a power button.  This iteration now makes use of bluetooth and an android app so that the device can be completely controlled from your android phone.
